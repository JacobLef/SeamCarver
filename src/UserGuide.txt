* USER GUIDE *

Welcome to the SeamCarver simulation. This is a program which will carve the most boring 'seams' out of an image, either vertical
or horizontal depending on what the user has selected. 

A 'seam' is a tree of nodes from either the left-most wall to the right-most wall or the top-most wall to the bottom-most wall. They
are highlighted in red before being removed. The image is then re-sized accordingly.

The simulation ends when there is only one horizontal or one vertical seam left to remove, so there is at least some image left. 

The user is able to interact with the seam-carver simulation, as described below.

NOTE: all commands *must* be lower-case

Space-bar : user can pause the simulation
\
lowercase-v (v) : switches the seam-carver simulation to only carve vertical seams and to not carve seams at random--i.e., not switch between vertical and 
horizontal at random

lowercase-h (h) : switches the seam-carver simulation to only carve horizontal seams and to not carve seams at random--i.e., not switch between vertical and
horizontal at random.

lowercase-q (q) : changes the energy 'mode' to 0 for different visual effects.

lowercase-r (r) : switches the seam-carver simulation to randomly choose between carving a vertical or horizontal
seam each time one is found.

lowercase-w (w) : changes the energy 'mode' to 1 for different visual effects.

lowercase-u (u) : undoes the most recent seam carved (adds it back). This action can be repeated so long as there
are seam-removals to undo. Once there are no seam removals to undo, this keyword does nothing.
