# SeamCarver

Welcome to my seam-carver simulation. This is a cool way to visualize how images can be compressed without losing any valuable information. 
The way to interact with the simulation as a user with the simulation is detailed in its entirety in the user guide text file, located in the 'src' directory.
The simulation is quite simple and lots of fun to play around with, so have fun!
