# SeamCarver

Welcome to my seam-carver simulation. This is a cool way to visualize how images can be compressed without losing any valuable information. 
The way to interact with the simulation as a user with the simulation is detailed in its entirety in the user guide text file, located in the 'src' directory.
The simulation is quite simple and lots of fun to play around with, but there are some instructions to actually running it that are stated below. 
Otherwise, have fun!

You will need to donwload the 'tester' and the 'javalib' jar files in order to run this simulation. Those can be found below. When you run the simulation,
enter the main class to be 'tester.Main'. Then, in the arguments section, write 'ExamplePixels' and click run. You are now good to go if you see an image
of ballons!
